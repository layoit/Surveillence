# üõ°Ô∏è Surveillance System - Person Detection & Recognition

A comprehensive web application that uses YOLO for person detection and face recognition to identify known and unknown individuals in video feeds. The system provides real-time alerts for unknown persons and allows you to manage a database of known people.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç Person Detection
- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Uses YOLOv8 for accurate person detection in video frames
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video frames to detect people
- **Bounding Box Detection**: Identifies person locations with precise bounding boxes

### üë§ Face Recognition
- **Face Extraction**: Automatically extracts faces from detected persons
- **Face Encoding**: Generates 128-dimensional face embeddings using `face_recognition` library
- **Similarity Matching**: Compares detected faces with known people database

### üìä Known People Management
- **Add Known People**: Upload photos and add names to the known people database
- **Face Database**: Stores face encodings for quick comparison
- **Person Profiles**: View all known people with their photos and details

### üö® Alert System
- **Unknown Person Detection**: Automatically detects and alerts for unknown individuals
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications when unknown persons are detected
- **Alert History**: View all past alerts with timestamps

### üéØ Unknown Person Management
- **Detection Log**: View all unknown person detections
- **Add to Known**: Easily add unknown persons to the known people database
- **Image Storage**: Automatically saves images of detected unknown persons

### üé® Modern Web Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, modern UI that works on all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard with automatic updates
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy file upload with drag and drop support
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time processing status indicators

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows 10/11 (tested on Windows)
- Webcam or video files for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd surveillance
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - The application will automatically create necessary directories and database

## üìã System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for models and database
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended for faster processing

### Software Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Browser**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root (optional):
```env
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Model Configuration
The system uses YOLOv8 by default. You can modify the model in `app.py`:
```python
# Change model size for different speed/accuracy trade-offs
yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # nano (fastest)
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8s.pt')  # small
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8m.pt')  # medium
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8l.pt')  # large
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8x.pt')  # extra large (most accurate)
```

### Face Recognition Settings
Adjust face recognition sensitivity in `app.py`:
```python
# Tolerance for face matching (lower = more strict)
tolerance = 0.6  # Default: 0.6 (60% similarity required)
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. Adding Known People

1. **Navigate to "Add Known Person" section**
2. **Enter the person's name** in the text field
3. **Upload a clear photo** of the person's face
   - Drag and drop an image file or click "Choose Image"
   - Ensure the face is clearly visible and well-lit
4. **Click "Add Person"** to save to the database

### 2. Processing Videos

1. **Navigate to "Video Processing" section**
2. **Upload a video file**
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV
   - Drag and drop or click "Choose Video"
3. **Processing starts automatically**
   - The system will analyze each frame for people
   - Known people are identified and logged
   - Unknown people trigger alerts

### 3. Managing Unknown Detections

1. **View unknown detections** in the "Unknown Detections" section
2. **Review detected images** to identify the person
3. **Click "Add"** next to any unknown person
4. **Enter their name** in the modal dialog
5. **Confirm** to add them to known people

### 4. Monitoring Alerts

- **Real-time alerts** appear in the "Recent Alerts" section
- **Alert details** include timestamp and detection information
- **Alert history** is automatically maintained
