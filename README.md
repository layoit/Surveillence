- Webcam or video files for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd surveillance
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - The application will automatically create necessary directories and database

## üìã System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for models and database
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended for faster processing

### Software Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Browser**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root (optional):
```env
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Model Configuration
The system uses YOLOv8 by default. You can modify the model in `app.py`:
```python
# Change model size for different speed/accuracy trade-offs
yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # nano (fastest)
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8s.pt')  # small
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8m.pt')  # medium
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8l.pt')  # large
# yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8x.pt')  # extra large (most accurate)
```

### Face Recognition Settings
Adjust face recognition sensitivity in `app.py`:
```python
# Tolerance for face matching (lower = more strict)
tolerance = 0.6  # Default: 0.6 (60% similarity required)
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. Adding Known People

1. **Navigate to "Add Known Person" section**
2. **Enter the person's name** in the text field
3. **Upload a clear photo** of the person's face
   - Drag and drop an image file or click "Choose Image"
   - Ensure the face is clearly visible and well-lit
4. **Click "Add Person"** to save to the database

### 2. Processing Videos

1. **Navigate to "Video Processing" section**
2. **Upload a video file**
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV
   - Drag and drop or click "Choose Video"
3. **Processing starts automatically**
   - The system will analyze each frame for people
   - Known people are identified and logged
   - Unknown people trigger alerts

### 3. Managing Unknown Detections

1. **View unknown detections** in the "Unknown Detections" section
2. **Review detected images** to identify the person
3. **Click "Add"** next to any unknown person
4. **Enter their name** in the modal dialog
5. **Confirm** to add them to known people

### 4. Monitoring Alerts

- **Real-time alerts** appear in the "Recent Alerts" section
- **Alert details** include timestamp and detection information
- **Alert history** is automatically maintained

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation Problems**
   ```bash
   # If you get dlib installation errors on Windows:
   pip install cmake
   pip install dlib
   ```

2. **CUDA/GPU Issues**
   ```bash
   # Install CPU-only PyTorch if GPU issues occur:
   pip uninstall torch torchvision
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce video resolution
   - Use smaller YOLO model (yolov8n.pt)
   - Process shorter video segments

4. **Face Detection Issues**
   - Ensure good lighting in images
   - Use clear, front-facing photos
   - Check that faces are not too small in images

### Performance Optimization

1. **Faster Processing**
   - Use YOLOv8n (nano) model
   - Reduce video resolution
   - Process fewer frames (increase frame skip)

2. **Better Accuracy**
   - Use YOLOv8x (extra large) model
   - Improve image quality
   - Use multiple photos per person

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: No data is sent to external services
- **Secure Storage**: Images and data stored locally
- **Access Control**: Consider adding authentication for production use

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Use a production WSGI server**
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```

2. **Add authentication**
   - Implement user login system
   - Add role-based access control
   - Secure API endpoints

3. **Database optimization**
   - Use PostgreSQL for larger datasets
   - Implement database indexing
   - Regular database maintenance

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
